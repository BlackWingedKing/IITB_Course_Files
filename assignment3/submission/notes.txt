I have used python3 for my assignment
First, I have read the the values of ns,na and gamma
I have used a model based method
I have estimated the values of R and T matrices (taking sample mean)
which are of the size ns x na x ns
Now, using the estimates, I have solved the mdp using lp 
I have used my own lp code from assignment 2 and solved for 
V(s) of each and every state.
